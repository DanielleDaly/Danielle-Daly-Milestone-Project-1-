# **FINGAL FARM**

**Introduction:**


Fingal Farm is a website based on a small local farming business in North County Dublin providing 100% organic and chemical free vegetables and pasture raised eggs. Users of this website can learn more about this farm, how they operate, what items they produce and how they can be purchased.

The site is targeted towards anyone who would like to buy organic food from their local community based in Dublin. The Fingal Farm website will be useful for existing and potential customers to find information about what produce is currently for sale, pricing and to place orders in advance of collection. It will also be useful for checking the collection points and times. 

**Features**


**Navigation Bar**


The navigation bar is featured on all three pages of the website. It includes a logo with the business name (Fingal Farm) and the business purpose (organic produce) on the top left hand side of the screen. This logo will bring users back to the home page when clicked.

On the top left hand side users can find links to the home page, our products page and the order now page. An active button has been included to provide a visual cue to the user showing what page they are currently on. If a user hovers over the links they will show as underlined.

The navigation bar is the same across all three pages in order to provide ease of use and consistency to the user. It also uses a contrasting colour scheme which allows the user to quickly navigate through the website. 

**The Home Page Image and Header**


The home page contains a hero image which provides a visual representation of the purpose of the website. The image contains text overlay advising the user of details about what the business supplies. The header provides some further details about Fingal Farm.

Below the header the user is provided with further information about the purpose of the website, the business and what it offers. 

The Ethos Section provides information to the website user about where the farm is located how it operates and the core values of the business. It provides details about their objectives and how this benefits their customers and potential customers.

The Our Products section provides a brief outline about what produce is for sale, how to purchase and how their food has been produced.

**Collection points section**


This section gives details of the times and locations that collections of fruit, vegetables and eggs can be made. This section will be updated as more location points and farmers markets are added over time. 

**The Footer**


The footer section contains links to Fingal Farm’s social media pages. These open in a new tab. Contact details for phone and email address have also been added to the footer. Icons are used to represent the social media linls and contact details.

**The Our Products Page**


The our products page provides more detail about what items the business offers for sale. It outlines the products currently available to purchase. These will be updated as the seasons change and different products become available. 

This will be valuable to the user as it outlines exactly what is currently available to purchase and the price of each item. It also provides details about how to order and what is included in the different veg-box options and egg carton sizes and pricing are also available.

Each item pops out when hovered over to provide a visual cue to the user about their location on the page.

**The Order Now Page**


This page allows users to pre-order their required items for collection. They will be asked to submit their name, email address and phone number. They can then select the veg-boxes or eggs required and their preferred pick up location.

When the user hovers over the sections for name, phone number and email address the input box is highlighted in a different colour. 

This has also been applied to the order now button.

**Testing**


I tested the website worked correctly on different browsers: Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

I confirmed the social media links work and open in a separate tab.

I checked that the order now form works. I confirmed that the required fields have been entered correctly and prompt the user if left blank. I confirmed that the email field will only accept an email and not any other for of input.
 
I used dev tools to check the screen is responsive and user friendly on different screen sizes.

I used the lighthouse function in dev tools to assess the website and ensure it is accessible for the  users.
