            <p>
                Sustainability and regenerative agriculture is at the heart of what we do. We work in harmony with nature to provide food as it should be, healthy, fresh and in season.

                <h2>Our Ethos</h2>
                <p> We are a local farmily-run enterprise based in North County Dublin. We believe eyeryone has the right to know where their food comes from and how it is produced. Our objective is to provide an alternative to mass produced food which relies heaily on monoculture, pesticides and is out of sync with nature. We offer real food; organic, free from pesticides and herbicides, ethically produced food that values plants, animals and nature. </p>

                <h2>Our Products</h2>
                <p>We supply a large range of fruit and vegetables that change with the seasons. All our food is 100% organic as certified by the Irish Organic Association. Our hens have a very happy life. They are free to forage throughout the day and fed on a diet of organic grain. The result is eggs that are free-range, chemical & anti-biotic free and egg-stremely delicious. </p>

                     <p>Working in tune with nature is at the heart of what we do. We know that healthy soil produces healthy food and in turn nourishes us. We say no to any pesticides and chemicals on our farm and in the aim of protecting the soil for generations to come. Our food is local which means no added air miles and none of our food is packaged using plastic.
